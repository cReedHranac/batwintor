\title{batwintor: A pacakge for computing the metabolic costs of hibernation on bats
with additional tools to address the impact of White-nose Syndrome on North
American species.}
\description{
The batwintor package includes 4 groups of functions, \code{Arrousal
Functions}, \code{Torpor Functions}, \code{Model Functions}, and \code{Plot
Functions}. In addition there are 3 data sets built into the package that
allow you to explore the majorit of the packages functions.
}
\section{Data}{

There are 3 data sets included within the package.
\code{\link{bat.params}}, \code{\link{mylu.params}}, and
\code{\link{fung.params}}. \code{bat.params} contains all of the parameter
estimations necessary to run the primary model for 12 species of North
American bats. Bat species involved are listed by their four letter code
(first two letters genus and species) as we got tired of writing out the
whole name every time. The parameters for \emph{Myotis
lucifugus}(\code{mylu}) is extracted from \code{bat.params} as an example
and stored as \code{\link{mylu.params}}. \code{\link{fung,params}} contains
the parameters required to calculate and scale the growth of
\emph{Pseduogymnoascans destructans}, the psycrophilic fungal agent
responsable for WNS.

\section{Torpor Functions}{

The \code{Torpor Fucntions} are used to calculate
how long a bat will maintain a torpid metabolic state
(\code{\link{CalcTorporTimePD}}), which is dependent largley on
\code{\link{CalcEWL}}, and \code{\link{CalcEnergyTimeTorpid}} is used to
determine the energy expended during those bouts of torpor.
}

\section{Arousal Functions}{

The \code{Arousal Functions} are designed to
explane the energry expendatures between bouts of torpor.
\code{\link{CalcArousalTime}} and \code{\link{CalcEnergyArousal}} document
the return from torpid body temperatures to euthermia. The functions
\code{\link{CalcEnergyTimeEuthermic}} describes energy expendature during
euthermia, and the \code{\link{CalcTimeFlying}} and
\code{\link{CalcEnergyFlying}} functions describe ammendments made to encourperate
the metabolic costs of flight during arousals. The \code{\link{CalcTimeCool}}
and \code{\link{CalcEnergyCool}} functions handle the return from eutheria
to torpid state and complete the arousal cycle.
}

\section{Model Functions}{

The model functions are the heart of the package and are composed of:
\code{\link{BuildEnv}}, \code{\link{DynamicModelPd}}, and
\code{\link{DetMod}}. The \code{BuildEnv} function allows you to create your
the parameter space that your model will run across in the form of
environmental spave and a time vector. The \code{DynamicEnergyPd} takes
the supplied environment, the parameters passed in and formats the data
for the \code{DetMod} which solves the differential equations.
\code{DynamicEnergyPD} then formats, and outputs the results for post-processing
and plotting
